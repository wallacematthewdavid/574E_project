## Wildfire Incidence in Arizona

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Our project investigates different approaches to spatial statistical modeling of wildfire incidence data in Arizona, with a focus on Coconino County (Northern AZ). 

The "Wildfire Incidence" data we will be studying specifies coordinates for a fire's origin, and its resulting size in acres.

Overall practical goal: modeling wildfire incidence to aid in prediction/assessment of wildfire risks in AZ based on relevant information.

Our incidence data uses the **National Interagency Fire Center** [Wildland Fire Incident Locations](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4402f7887ca4ea9a6189443f220ef28_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.38) dataset. 

This dataset includes point locations and corresponding data for all wildland fires in the United States reported to the [IRWIN system](https://www.wildfire.gov/application/irwin-integrated-reporting-wildfire-information), which aggregates wildfire incidence data from around the country. 

The dataset has all IRWIN data entries since 2014 (it is still updated daily).

There are over 300K records in this dataset, and just over 18K in Arizona.

Refinement of this dataset utilized the following data attributes (of 96 columns) for incidence filtering & covariates.

- `x` and `y` | Spatial coordinates in lat/lon
- `IncidentSize` | Size of the resulting wildfire in acres
- `FireCause` | Human, Natural, Unknown, Undetermined
- `FireDiscoveryDateTime` | Date & time of incident reporting
- `IncidentTypeCategory` | WF (wildfire) or RX (prescribed burn)

## Research Question 1

### In what ways can we approach spatial modeling of this data to produce useful insights?

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Continuous, Fixed Spatial Index

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can approach our data from different angles.

 - **Continuous, fixed** - Treating `x` and `y` as coordinates as fixed and using `IncidentSize` as a continuous response, our data is geostatistical.

#### Modeling approach

- **Spatial Linear Model** - Module 2, similar to Holland example in *Continuously indexed spatial data (geostatistics)*, or the `dioxane` analysis in HW2.

$$
\boldsymbol{\mathrm{y}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{e}\,\,\,\,\boldsymbol{e}\sim\mathrm{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta}))
$$

## Wildfire Incidence Data - Point Process 1

This dataset offered us a unique opportunity to take multiple approaches to spatial statistical modeling. Using the available data attributes, we can approach our data from different angles.

 - **Point process** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as a *threshold*, we can study "large wildfires" (`IncidentSize` $\geq 1000$ acres) as point process data. 


#### Modeling approach

- **Log-Gaussian Cox Process** Module 4, similar to Gorillas LGCP example in *Random spatial index (point pattern)*, or the `earthquakes_um` analysis of Kansas in HW4.

$$
\log(\lambda(u))=\mathrm{\boldsymbol{Z}}(u)\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(u),\,\,\,\,e(u)\sim\mathrm{N}(0,C(\boldsymbol{\theta})),\,\,\,\,C(u,u')=\sigma^{2}e^{-||u-u'||/h}

Roads and wildfires in AZ

:::

Data explorations showed some clear wildfire patterns near roads (the outlines are visible). We wanted to include the distance in meters to the nearest major roads (and "remote" roads) as usable predictors. For each point, the `roads()` function in the `tigris` package to generate `sf` objects for AZ roads, and `st_distance()` function in the `sf` package helped us generate this data to be used as a covariate.



## Research Questions (2)


#### Can we find useful covariate data that can improve our models?

Raymond and Matt collected data for environmental and human factors to address research question 2 (RQ2) in our modeling efforts.

Matt's LGCP models address research question 3.

## Modeling - Coconino County
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

We opted to focus our modeling efforts on Coconino County based on some inital model fits, and overall size of the dataset. 

Coconino County is home to national forests like Coconino, Kaibab, and Apache-Sitgreaves, and has the most wildfire incidence in the state by a good margin.

## Binary GLM Spatial approach

 - **Point process** - Using `x` and `y` as coordinates and `IncidentSize` as a *threshold*, we can study "large wildfires" (`IncidentSize` $\geq 1000$ acres) as point process data.


#### Modeling approach

- **Binary Response Spatial Logistic Regression** - Module 5, similar to Gorillas Logistic Regression GLM example in *Non-Gaussian spatial data*.

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})+\log(\lambda_{0}),
$$ 

::: {.smallmath}
$$
Y(\boldsymbol{s}) \sim \mathrm{Bern}(p(\boldsymbol{s})),\,\,\,\, \mathrm{E}[ Y (\boldsymbol{s}) ] = p(\boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}{\lambda_{0}(\boldsymbol{s})+\lambda_{1}(\boldsymbol{s})}
$$

## Binary GLM Spatial approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

We now want to study risk of occurence of large wildfire (`Indidentsize`$\geq 1000$ acres) spatially in terms of probabilities. We will also restrict occurrences to `FireCause=="Natural"`. 

To build the model, we filter the data and treat large wildfire incident locations as a realization of a point process with intensity surface $\lambda_1(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})$. 

For these points, we assign a response value of $Y(\boldsymbol{s})=1$ (`Wildfires`).

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\lambda_{1}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}}))=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}}(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})^{T}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\underset{\text{spatial effect}}{\underbrace{e(\mathrm{\boldsymbol{s}})}}+\log(\lambda_{0}),

Next we generate a background realization of a known constant Poisson process $\lambda_0$, which represent locations that a large wildfire could have happened but did not (note incident date/time is randomly assigned 2014 to present). 

We also collect all the covariate data at these points (time consuming).

For these points, we assign a response value of $Y(\boldsymbol{s})=0$  (`Wildfires`).

## Binary GLM Spatial approach

Our model can then be built using selected covariates we desire for predictors and performing a binary logistic regression. The resulting prediction model will return the probability of the occurrence of a large wildfire for a given input location and corresponding values for the model's chosen covariates.

##### Model Selection

The selection of covariates of the model utilized a semi-automated process that minimized AIC. There were some issues with model convergence for some spatial covariance fits, and AIC did not necessarily favor significant predictors in the end.

```r
spglm_formula <- Wildfires ~  I(sqrt(distance_rd_min_isprisec)) + I(log(pop.density)) +
  Precipitation_Buffered * Temp_Min_Buffered + I(get_season(FireDiscoveryDateTime)) +
  mean_grass * mean_forest

az_wf_spcov <- spcov_initial("wave")

az_wf_spglm <- spglm(spglm_formula, data = model_data_sf, 
                     family = binomial, spcov_initial = az_wf_spcov)

Due to some challenges we faced with the computational time/energy to recover realistic data for covariates, our ability to generate appropriate covariate data for predictions disallowed predictions with high resolution. 

We generated a grid of equally spaced points within Coconino County, amounting to 293 total points to use as prediction locations. All prediction covariate data was captured for `2023-12-31 12:00:00`.

This is the result prediction surface (treating each grid point prediction as representative probability for the pixel's region), and the wildfire incidence points as well as the areas of national forests in the region overlayed.

**Not totally outrageous!**

#### Well...maybe a little outrageous?

More background process points? Predictors correlated? Spatial confounding?


## Conclusions and Future Research

- Models at least demonstrate proof-of-concept (RQ1)

- We found covariate data that improved our models (RQ2)

- We found some interesting patterns of CSR/non-CSR for different types of fire incidence (RQ3)

## Conclusions and Future Research

With some extra refinement, they could feasibly aid in better allocation of resources for fire prevention, possible forecasting, and information that can be coupled with other ecological models.

Some considerations for future model refinements.

- Better methods for recovering covariate data for better predictions
- Spatio-Temporal modeling?
- More careful treatment of highly correlated predictors
- More points for background realization for Binary model
- Other model scoring/tuning

There is also a lot more that can be done with this dataset, we encourage you to check it out!
